# AP-Physics-is-a-Nightmare
2 and a half months, what have I done? Not studied for AP Physics, gotta get on the grind or else I'm screwed.
This repo contains my notes for AP Physics, based on ***Fundamental of Physics, 10th Edition Extended***, by Halliday & Resnick

## What the heck are you gonna do in the two weeks you have till school starts?
I'm gonna work a couple of chapters ahead so I don't die *immediately* during the school year.

## Why the heck are you using github
I write a lot of markdown, so I may as well write my notes than upload it to git, so I don't lose my notes after a weekly distro-hop. I might write some rust or python in this repo as an extension of concepts learned from this book

## Why not get a real book nerd and annotate
Textbooks are expensive, and I hate annotating pages since I don't have much space, and I hate stickies

## Then why not annotate a PDF
Meh my brain is weird, only learns from notes or doesn't learn at all. Annotations never work for me : (

## How is this organized
Every chapter get's it's own folder, each containing a README containg my notes for the chapter. There may be further folders containg other material (such as code).
