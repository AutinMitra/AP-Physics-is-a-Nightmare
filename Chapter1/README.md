# Chapter 1: Measurement
*oh wow this physics stuff is easy. It's gonna keep being like this, right? right???*

We learned most of this chapter from stuff such as Chemistry, so no need to pay much attention to this chapter, carry on.

## 1.1: Measuring things, including lengths
#### Why do we need measurements?
- Physics is discovered by measuring quantities from physics
	- length, time, mass, temperature, pressure, electric current, etc.
- Standard unit is... the standard unit (1.0 - such as meters for length)
- Once a standard is  set up, we gotta find out how to measure it
	- Rulers can be used to measure say my hand length, but sure as hell can't measure the radius of an atom
### Base quantities
- There are so many physical numbers, it's hard to organize
- A lot of these quantities, however, are dependent
	- Speed = distance / time
	- We can pick out these group of dependent base quantities, and assign a standard based on their **base standards** (input quantity standards)
		- Speed has two **base quantities**: Distance and Time
		- Speed has two **base standards**: (example) Miles and Hours
### International System of Units
- Abbreviated as SI, but we know it as the metric system
- Many units are **derived units**
	- Basically a mathematical combination of SI units
	- For example, watts (W) are defined by mass (kg), length (m), and time (s)
- There are also a bunch of prefixes to deal with huge/tiny numbers (see page 2, Table 1-1)

### Changing units
- Sometimes the units of something needs to be changed
	- We call this **chain-link conversion**
		- It's basically that conversion thing we did in chemistry, I forgot what that's called
	-  We use a **conversion factor** and multiply that against the original value
		- 1 minute = 60 seconds, so multiply minutes by 60 to get time in seconds, duh
### Length
- Brief history of the meter
	- It was 1792, the Republic of France established some measurements	
	- Defined the meter as ten-millionth of the distance from the north pole to the equator
	- **Standard meter bar** was the distance between two lines engraved at the end of a platinum-iridium bar
		- Accurate clones of these bars were sent to laboratories around the world
		-  These standards were used to produce other accessible standards
	- Later, the meter was defined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of a particular orange-red light emitted by krypton-86
	- *^^^ All this history stuff doesn't really matter, booooooring*
### Sig Figs: oh no not this again
- Well, I did this *a lot* in chemistry, so I don't think I need to speak too much to this
- Basic recap, more sig figs mean more precision
- Sig Figs are rounded to match the least number of sigfigs in the given data
- We assume (at least in this book) that in a number such as 3000, all the zeros are significant, but don't take this out to the real-world

## 1.2: Time
### What's time and it's purpose
- We wanna know what time of day it is for sequential organization of events or how long things last
- Anything that repeats itself is a possible standard for time
	- Earth's repeating rotation determines the length of the day, used for time for centuries
	- An atomic clock in Colorado serves for UTC time for the sake of a better time standard
		- Atomic clocks are very consistent, that it would take 6000 years for readings to differ more than 1s between clocks
- *Wow that was a short section*

## 1.3: Mass
### The standard Kilogram
- SI standard for mass is a cylinder of platinum and iridium, kept in the International Bureau of Weights and measures (huh it seems like a lot of measurement stuffs are kept here)
	- Made in international agreement, and accurate copies sent to other laboratories all over the world
- US's copy is stored at a vault at NIST, and is only taken out every once in a while to check other copies
### Second mass Standard
- It's so much easier to compare atoms to each other, than to measure it with the standard kilogram
	- As  a result we have the second mass standard
- This second mass standard is the carbon-12 atom, which is assigned a mass of 12 **atomic units**
	- 1u = 1.66053886 * 10^-27 kg

### Density
- Density is mass over volume
	- œÅ = m / V 
- Typically listed in kilograms per cubic meters or grams per cubic cm
- Density of water is often used for comparison (1.00g per cubic cm)
	- Fresh snow = 10% of that density
	- Platinum has about 21x the density of water
